This folder gathers water level data of Sava and Danube rivers in Belgrade, Pancevo and Zemun organized in 3 csv files. Each one for each city.  

Sava river data --> Belgrade (from 2000 to 2022)  

Danube river data --> Pancevo (from 2000 to 2021 (there isn't data from 2022? I couldn't find it in the repository)) and Zemun (from 2000 to 2022).  

All data were extracted from the csv files that had been published in this repository (the files were separated by year).
