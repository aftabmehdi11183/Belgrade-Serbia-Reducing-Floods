# Goals

1) Give clean & good data to model building pipe after data analysis and processing
2) Recommend suitable classification metrics to use

# Tasks

1) Validate data, Verify data-types of feature and target
2) Check duplicate, Handle missing values, encoding/normalization
3) Five point Summary
4) Find out how to balance the dataset other wise model will be biased
5) Heatmap?
6) Independent and Depedantant variables/features
7) Weekly, Monthly, Daily water level plot and analysis at each check point
8) Box-plot and Skewness should not be altered as mentioned in books - could be a indicator for flood
9) Is the data sufficient to build model for our usecase?
